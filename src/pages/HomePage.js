            Welcome to my personal page! I made this site from scratch using
            React.JS and Material-UI! You'll find a bit of everything here and
            there. Feel free to look around and check back every now and again
            to see any updates to the site. It's pretty simple for now but I'll
            continue growing and expanding this webpage as I go through my
            developer journey.{" "}
