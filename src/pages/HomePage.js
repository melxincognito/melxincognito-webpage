            Welcome to my page! I'm a Software Developer who makes Web
            applications using React.JS and Python. I learned how to program
            applications a few years after I graduated from Arizona State
            University with a Bachelors in Business Law. I utilize my background
            in both business and programming to work with my clients to ensure
            their applications are both high quality and good from a marketing
            standpoint.
