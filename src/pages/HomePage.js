            Welcome to my personal page! I made this site from scratch using
            React.JS and Material-UI! It's pretty simple now but I'll continue
            growing and expanding this webpage as I go through my developer
            journey. Feel free to look around and check back every now and again
            to see any updates to the site!{" "}
