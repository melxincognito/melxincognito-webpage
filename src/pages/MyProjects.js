              experience in web development but I'm very eager to learn and
              apply best practices. Thus far, I've made many websites with
              WordPress and Adobe Portfolio but I didn't feel like I was getting
              level of customization I wanted only being able to build
              everything from an online platform. I started to make this site
              from scratch with React to really learn all the nuts and bolts of
              programming! I plan to continue building and maintaining sites so
              I can learn to develop reliable web applications. Once I become
              more advanced with ReactJS I plan to develop reliable mobile
              applications with React Native.

                  I know the list is small but I know my passion will allow me
                  to progress forward quickly. My goal by the end of 2022 is to
                  develop at least three large scale applications in my
                  portfolio using React!
