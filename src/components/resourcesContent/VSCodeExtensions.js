              There are a lot of different productivity extensions out there,
              these are just the ones I use on a regular basis.

                    Prettier Code Formatter
                  </Link>{" "}
                  is amazing, I don't know how I went so long without this
                  extension. It's an opinionated code formatter that formats
                  your code so it's easily readable. If your code has an error
                  like a missing bracket it won't format on save so it's a good
                  cue to take another look at your code before you run. When you
                  first download it you have to do a special key combo to format
                  it, change the settings so it formats on save and it's a lot
                  more useful. To turn prettier on and have it format on save:
                  <ul>
                    {" "}
                    <li>
                      Navigate to <strong>Prefrences</strong> >
                      <strong> Settings</strong> > Search{" "}
                      <strong>'format document' </strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      {" "}
                      Under <strong> Editor: Default Formatter</strong>, click
                      the menu button and select{" "}
                      <strong> Prettier - Code formatter</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      {" "}
                      Look below and check the box under{" "}
                      <strong>Editor: Format On Save</strong>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                    Live Server
                  </Link>{" "}
                  is another good extension. It launches a development server
                  with the page you're creating and it reloads live with each
                  save so you don't have to keep relaunching every time you make
                  a change.

                    ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippits
                  </Link>{" "}
                  is a total time saver. It comes with snippits so you dont have
                  to type out commonly used commands like import React from
                  'react', it can make a skeleton of a functional/class
                  component, etc. The things that aren't difficult but can be
                  tedious.

                  color codes your round, squiggly and square brackets so it
                  stands out from the rest of your code and you can locate which
                  bracket goes with which. It saves you a lot of trouble, I
                  don't know how many times I spent hours looking for the reason
                  my project was crashing only to find I was missing a single }

              Once I found out you can change the color theme of your code
              editor I wondered how I was looking at the default one for so
              long! You're going to be looking at your editor for hours on end
              so it may as well be appealing to your eyes. There's plenty out
              there so you can look around to see which ones you like. I like
              high contrast themes, so far my favorites have been:
